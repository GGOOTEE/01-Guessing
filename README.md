# 01-Guessing
This is my first attempt at following my instructor in C220 to create a working guessing game, written in python. The goal of this game is to teach me about simple data types and control structures. 

The player is prompted with being asked their name, and then they are asked to and picks a number from 1 to 20, if it is the computers random number that was selected then the playwer wins. Vice-versa. The game reports the total number of attempts and if the player wants to play again.
